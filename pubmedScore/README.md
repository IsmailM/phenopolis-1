# PubmedScore

Genes are prioritised by PubmedScore calculated using literature support. PubMed publications are mined for interesting phenotypes given relevant keywords. Users may also supply a list of genes of interest that are known to be associated with the phenotype. PubmedScore will assign at least a score of 1 to the genes on the given list. This will help to keep those genes on top of the result table if the user choose to sort it by the Pubmed Relevance Score.
